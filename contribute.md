# Contributor's Guide

Without proper rules this repo will endup being peice of cr*p. We want to build a awesome project not cr-word.

**I don't know if I can emphasize this enough, but keep you code clean, well commented and maintainable.**
**Maintainability is everythiiiingg!!!!**


## What Can You Contribute? 
1. Check out project [README](https://github.com/primeninja/yelp-camp-advanced/blob/master/readme.md) for list of **TODO**s under TODO's section if any. If you can accomplish these todo's without bugs and awesome code conventions and login. Your pull request will be pulled for sure.
2. Documentation may not look like much but it accounts to 70% of success of repo. Any body can code, not many can add proper documentation to it. 

If you are documenting out code, adding comments, adding how to instructions in readme. You'll recieve a special thanks from me for sure!!
3. Code elites! Please do help us optimise! 




#### Some rules to follow
1. This is a software repo not school and you are / going to be a professional dev. So you gotta follow some rule, no excuses    
2. No new frameworks will be added. We don't use **angular.js** here. 
3. Write complex code not complicated code.
4. Use proper comments wherever necessary.
  
**Awful coding practice**
``` javascript
    // increment ravagers variable
    ++ravagers;
```

**Good coding practice**
``` javascript
    // add more ravagers to current game scene.
    ++ravagers;
```

Write what your code accomplishes. We are NOT asking you to explain us javascript syntax, most probably we know it better than you do.
5. Try not to use bleeding features of ES5 or ES6, this will break backwards compatibility.
6. Add a proper thought out title and description to your pull request.
