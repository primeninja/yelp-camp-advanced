# Contributor's Guide

Without proper rules this repo will endup being peice of cr*p. We want to build a awesome project not cr-word.


#### Some rules to follow
1. This is a software repo not school and you are / going to be a professional dev. So you gotta follow some rule, no excuses    
2. No new frameworks will be added. We don't use **angular.js** here. 
3. Write complex code not complicated code.
4. Use proper comments wherever necessary.
  
**Awful coding practice**
``` javascript
    // increment ravagers variable
    ++ravagers;
```

**Good coding practice**
``` javascript
    // add more ravagers to current game scene.
    ++ravagers;
```

Write what your code accomplishes. We are NOT asking you to explain us javascript syntax, most probably we know it better than you do.
5. Try not to use bleeding features of ES5 or ES6, this will break backwards compatibility.
6. Add a proper thought out title and description to your pull request.
